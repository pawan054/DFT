# DFT_tutorial
Density Functional Theory(DFT)
In this repository, I will discribe DFT computational methods to get electronic, magnetic, optical, and thermelectric properties of solids using DFT codes such as:
VASP
FPLO
WIEN2K
QE
Phonon calculations in phonopy
and Boltztrap and so on...........
To use the files, open .md file and follow the commands accordingly.
Lines starting with symbol $ are direct commands which you can easily copy and paste on your terminal.
But, becareful while running. Make necessary chnages.
Lines with symbol ! are suggestions.
